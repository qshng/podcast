# Podcast Recommender

Podcast recommender/search engine based on episode contents.

This is my personal project for me to play with:

1. Web scraping - Scrapy, Selenium
2. Web development - Flask, React
3. Full text search - Elastic Search, Whoosh, Lucene
4. Recommender system
5. NLP, text analysis


- Crawler

Crawls [iTunes podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/podcasts/id26?mt=2 ) using Scrapy.
